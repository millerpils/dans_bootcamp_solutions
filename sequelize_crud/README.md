# Intro/about

An additional Sequelize CRUD app example that has Restaurants, Menus and Menu Items.

# Usage

- Run NPM install
- Run `node index`. This should create and connect to the DB
- This will also insert some test Restaurant, Menu and MenuItem data

# Notes

- [DB Browser](https://sqlitebrowser.org/dl/) is a great tool to see the foreign keys Sequelize adds for you

# Future development

Make it better?

Happy hacking!
